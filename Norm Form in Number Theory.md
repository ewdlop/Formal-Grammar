The Norm form, particularly in number theory, refers to an algebraic form that defines a number field extension. It is used to study properties of algebraic numbers and their relationships. Let's explore how to represent and work with norm forms in Python using the `sympy` library for symbolic mathematics.

### Example: Norm Form in Number Theory

Consider an algebraic number field \( L = \mathbb{Q}(\alpha) \), where \(\alpha\) is a root of a polynomial over \(\mathbb{Q}\). The norm of an element \( x \in L \) is the product of all the Galois conjugates of \( x \).

Let's take a simple example of a quadratic field \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) \).

### Steps:
1. Define the polynomial whose root generates the number field.
2. Define the element whose norm we want to calculate.
3. Compute the norm of the element.

Here's how you can do it in Python with `sympy`:

```python
from sympy import symbols, sqrt, expand

# Define the symbol
d = symbols('d')
alpha = sqrt(d)

# Define the element in the number field
x = symbols('x')
element = x + alpha

# Compute the norm of the element
# For a quadratic field, the norm of (a + b*sqrt(d)) is (a + b*sqrt(d))(a - b*sqrt(d)) = a^2 - b^2*d
a, b = symbols('a b')
element = a + b * alpha
conjugate_element = a - b * alpha

# Norm is the product of the element and its conjugate
norm = expand(element * conjugate_element)

print(f"The norm of the element {element} is: {norm}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Symbols and Elements**:
   - Define the symbol `d` which will be used in the quadratic field.
   - Define `alpha` as the square root of `d`.
   - Define the element `a + b*sqrt(d)` in the number field \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}) \).

2. **Conjugate and Norm**:
   - The conjugate of `a + b*sqrt(d)` is `a - b*sqrt(d)`.
   - The norm of the element is the product of the element and its conjugate: `a^2 - b^2 * d`.

### Example Usage:

Let's consider a specific example where \( d = 2 \):
```python
from sympy import simplify

# Specific example with d = 2
norm_specific = norm.subs(d, 2)
element_specific = element.subs({d: 2, a: 3, b: 4})

print(f"The norm of the element {element_specific} in the field Q(sqrt(2)) is: {simplify(norm_specific)}")
```

In this example, we substitute `d = 2` and compute the norm for a specific element \( 3 + 4\sqrt{2} \).

This approach can be extended to more complex algebraic number fields and elements, using similar principles. The `sympy` library is very powerful for symbolic computation and can handle a wide range of algebraic operations.
